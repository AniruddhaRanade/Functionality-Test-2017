# Functionality-Test-2017 |Advitiya| Electrical Subsytem|

Hello, everyone :smiley:

We are the **Electrical Subsystem** of **Student Satellite Team, IIT Bombay**. This is our repository where we will be maintaining the codes for functionality tests. 

</br>

The aim of functionality test is to ensure that the electrical subsystem as a whole as well as every individual component of the subsystem is tested and is proven to be bulletproof. We aim to create a generic testbench for the entire subsystem.
Executing these tests also involves a great deal of learning in terms of Embedded C experience and debugging skills.  

The functionality Tests are being carried out on the flight hardware of the satellite. 


## Some rules/protocols to be followed if you wish to contribute to this repository:

- When you create a new Atmel studio project(Windows) or a folder(Linux) ensure that the name is in accordance with the task as it would ease the process of tracking down the codes. 

- Here's an example which you might want to follow: 
**Name:** {_board names__peripherals_FT2017_Name_} 
**example** : OBCm-OBCs-Power--GPS--FT2017--Aniruddha {m for master and s for slave}  

- Make sure that your code is [indented](https://blog.programminghub.io/blog/2017/06/07importance-indentation-programming/) 

- Also, make sure you create C executable project in Atmel studio 

- You can have a look at the existing codes for reference
